The diagram shows a real computer (the host) running VirtualBox software to create two virtual computers inside it. One virtual computer is a workstation using Ubuntu, and the other is an SSH server also using Ubuntu. The host connects to both virtual computers through VirtualBox. The two virtual computers talk to each other over a private network with addresses like 192.168.56.101 and 192.168.56.102. The workstation can log into the server using SSH on port 22.
